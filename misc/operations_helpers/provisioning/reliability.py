class ReliabilityModel(object):
    """Generate a model of system-wide reliability, given several input
    parameters.

    This runs a simulation in which time is quantized down to 'delta' seconds
    (default is one month): a smaller delta will result in a more accurate
    simulation, but will take longer to run. 'report_span' simulated seconds
    will be run.

    The encoding parameters are provided as 'k' (minimum number of shares
    needed to recover the file) and 'N' (total number of shares generated).
    The default parameters are 3-of-10.

    The first step is to build a probability of individual drive loss during
    any given delta. This uses a simple exponential model, in which the
    average drive lifetime is specified by the 'drive_lifetime' parameter
    (default is 8 years).

    The second step is to calculate a 'transition matrix': a table of
    probabilities that shows, given A shares at the start of the delta, what
    the chances are of having B shares left at the end of the delta. The
    current code optimistically assumes all drives are independent. A
    subclass could override that assumption.

    An additional 'repair matrix' is created to show what happens when the
    Checker/Repairer is run. In the simulation, the Checker will be run every
    'check_period' seconds (default is one month), and the Repairer will be
    run if it sees fewer than 'R' shares (default 7).

    The third step is to finally run the simulation. An initial probability
    vector is created (with a 100% chance of N shares and a 0% chance of
    fewer than N shares), then it is multiplied by the transition matrix for
    every delta of time. Each time the Checker is to be run, the repair
    matrix is multiplied in, and some additional stats are accumulated
    (average number of repairs that occur, average number of shares
    regenerated per repair).

    The output is a ReliabilityReport instance, which contains a table that
    samples the state of the simulation once each 'report_period' seconds
    (defaults to 3 months). Each row of this table will contain the
    probability vector for one sample period (chance of having X shares, from
    0 to N, at the end of the period). The report will also contain other
    information.
