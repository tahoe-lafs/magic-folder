# Of course, we depend on Twisted.  Let Tahoe-LAFS' Twisted dependency
# declaration serve, though.  Otherwise we have to be careful to agree on
# which extras to pull in.
#
# Additionally, pin Tahoe-LAFS to a specific version we know works.
# Magic-Folder still uses a couple private Tahoe-LAFS Python APIs so there's
# good reason to expect things to break from release to release.  Pin it here
# so we can upgrade intentionally when we know it will work.
#
# We could pin a single specific version but this sometimes causes packaging
# problems (where a packaged version might be something like X.Y.Z.post1).
# Instead, pin a very narrow range that should only include a single upstream
# release but allows for these kind of packager versions.
