# Of course, we depend on Twisted.  Let Tahoe-LAFS' Twisted dependency
# declaration serve, though.  Otherwise we have to be careful to agree on
# which extras to pull in.

# Although there are still some allmydata.* imports (so we depend on
# tahoe-lafs) these are confied to allmydata.uri so this dependency is
