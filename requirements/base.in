# Of course, we depend on Twisted.  Let Tahoe-LAFS' Twisted dependency
# declaration serve, though.  Otherwise we have to be careful to agree on
# which extras to pull in.

# Additionally, pin Tahoe-LAFS to a specific version we know works.
# Magic-Folder uses a lot of private Tahoe-LAFS Python APIs so there's
# good reason to expect things to break from release to release.  Pin a
# specific version so we can upgrade intentionally when we know it will
