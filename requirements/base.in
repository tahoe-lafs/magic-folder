# Of course, we depend on Twisted.  Let Tahoe-LAFS' Twisted dependency
# declaration serve, though.  Otherwise we have to be careful to agree on
# which extras to pull in.
#
# Additionally, pin Tahoe-LAFS to a specific version we know works.
# Magic-Folder still uses a couple private Tahoe-LAFS Python APIs so
# there's good reason to expect things to break from release to
# release.  Pin a specific version so we can upgrade intentionally
# when we know it will work.
#
# This is "slightly open-ended" here to let e.g. NixOS's packager
# install .postX development versions of Tahoe but will still get
# an exact pin for magic-folders releases
