Install:

   pip install -e .[test]

run:

   py.test -s -v integration/

If you want to keep the created temp-dir around:

   py.test --keep-tempdir -v integration/

The fixtures also set up a "flogtool gather" process and dump all the
logs from all the running processes (introducer, 5 storage nodes,
alice, bob) to a tempfile.
