    #      right way of doing things.

    # In general, we leave it to callers to ensure that they aren't
    # going to cause UncoordinatedWriteErrors when working with
    # MutableFileVersions. We know that the next three operations
    # (upload, overwrite, and modify) will all operate on the same
    # version, so we say that only one of them can be going on at once,
    # and serialize them to ensure that that actually happens, since as
    # the caller in this situation it is our job to do that.

        random delay between subsequent attempts, to help competing updates

        The backoffer is given two arguments: this MutableFileNode, and the

        return a Deferred that will fire when the next attempt should be

        backoffer=None, a default one is provided which will perform
        exponential backoff, and give up after 4 tries. Note that the
