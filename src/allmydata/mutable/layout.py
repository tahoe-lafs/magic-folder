# These strings describe the format of the packed structs they help process.
# Here's what they mean:
#
#  PREFIX:
#    >: Big-endian byte order; the most significant byte is first (leftmost).
#    B: The container version information; stored as an unsigned 8-bit integer.
#       This is currently either SDMF_VERSION or MDMF_VERSION.
#    Q: The sequence number; this is sort of like a revision history for
#       mutable files; they start at 1 and increase as they are changed after
#       being uploaded. Stored as an unsigned 64-bit integer.
#  32s: The root hash of the share hash tree. We use sha-256d, so we use 32
#       bytes to store the value.
#  16s: The salt for the readkey. This is a 16-byte random value.
#
#  SIGNED_PREFIX additions, things that are covered by the signature:
#    B: The "k" encoding parameter. We store this as an unsigned 8-bit
#       integer, since our erasure coding scheme cannot encode to more than
#       255 pieces.
#    B: The "N" encoding parameter. Stored as an unsigned 8-bit integer for
#       the same reason as above.
#    Q: The segment size of the uploaded file. This is an unsigned 64-bit
#       integer, to allow handling large segments and files. For SDMF the
#       segment size is the data length plus padding; for MDMF it can be
#       smaller.
#    Q: The data length of the uploaded file. Like the segment size field,
#       it is an unsigned 64-bit integer.
#
#   HEADER additions:
#     L: The offset of the signature. An unsigned 32-bit integer.
#     L: The offset of the share hash chain. An unsigned 32-bit integer.
#     L: The offset of the block hash tree. An unsigned 32-bit integer.
#     L: The offset of the share data. An unsigned 32-bit integer.
#     Q: The offset of the encrypted private key. An unsigned 64-bit integer,
#        to account for the possibility of a lot of share data.
#     Q: The offset of the EOF. An unsigned 64-bit integer, to account for
#        the possibility of a lot of share data.
#
#  After all of these, we have the following:
#    - The verification key: Occupies the space between the end of the header
#      and the start of the signature (i.e.: data[HEADER_LENGTH:o['signature']].
#    - The signature, which goes from the signature offset to the share hash
#      chain offset.
#    - The share hash chain, which goes from the share hash chain offset to
#      the block hash tree offset.
#    - The share data, which goes from the share data offset to the encrypted
#      private key offset.
#    - The encrypted private key offset, which goes until the end of the file.
#
#  The block hash tree in this encoding has only one share, so the offset of
#  the share data will be 32 bits more than the offset of the block hash tree.
#  Given this, we may need to check to see how many bytes a reasonably sized
#  block hash tree will take up.

    #
    # We order the fields that way to make smart downloaders -- downloaders
    # which prempetively read a big part of the share -- possible.
    #
    # The checkstring is the first three fields -- the version number,
    # sequence number, root hash and root salt hash. This is consistent
    # in meaning to what we have with SDMF files, except now instead of
    # using the literal salt, we use a value derived from all of the
    # salts -- the share hash root.
    #
    # The salt is stored before the block for each segment. The block
    # hash tree is computed over the combination of block and salt for
    # each segment. In this way, we get integrity checking for both
    # block and salt with the current block hash tree arrangement.
    #
    # The ordering of the offsets is different to reflect the dependencies
    # that we'll run into with an MDMF file. The expected write flow is
    # something like this:
    #
    #   0: Initialize with the sequence number, encoding parameters and
    #      data length. From this, we can deduce the number of segments,
    #      and where they should go.. We can also figure out where the
    #      encrypted private key should go, because we can figure out how
    #      big the share data will be.
    #
    #   1: Encrypt, encode, and upload the file in chunks. Do something
    #      like
    #
    #       put_block(data, segnum, salt)
    #
    #      to write a block and a salt to the disk. We can do both of
    #      these operations now because we have enough of the offsets to
    #      know where to put them.
    #
    #   2: Put the encrypted private key. Use:
    #
    #        put_encprivkey(encprivkey)
    #
    #      Now that we know the length of the private key, we can fill
    #      in the offset for the block hash tree.
    #
    #   3: We're now in a position to upload the block hash tree for
    #      a share. Put that using something like:
    #
    #        put_blockhashes(block_hash_tree)
    #
    #      Note that block_hash_tree is a list of hashes -- we'll take
    #      care of the details of serializing that appropriately. When
    #      we get the block hash tree, we are also in a position to
    #      calculate the offset for the share hash chain, and fill that
    #      into the offsets table.
    #
    #   4: We're now in a position to upload the share hash chain for
    #      a share. Do that with something like:
    #
    #        put_sharehashes(share_hash_chain)
    #
    #      share_hash_chain should be a dictionary mapping shnums to
    #      32-byte hashes -- the wrapper handles serialization.
    #      We'll know where to put the signature at this point, also.
    #      The root of this tree will be put explicitly in the next
    #      step.
    #
    #   5: Before putting the signature, we must first put the
    #      root_hash. Do this with:
    #
    #        put_root_hash(root_hash).
    #
    #      In terms of knowing where to put this value, it was always
    #      possible to place it, but it makes sense semantically to
    #      place it after the share hash tree, so that's why you do it
    #      in this order.
    #
    #   6: With the root hash put, we can now sign the header. Use:
    #
    #        get_signable()
    #
    #      to get the part of the header that you want to sign, and use:
    #
    #        put_signature(signature)
    #
    #      to write your signature to the remote server.
    #
    #   6: Add the verification key, and finish. Do:
    #
    #        put_verification_key(key)
    #
    #      and
    #
    #        finish_publish()
    #
    # Checkstring management:
    #
    # To write to a mutable slot, we have to provide test vectors to ensure
    # that we are writing to the same data that we think we are. These
    # vectors allow us to detect uncoordinated writes; that is, writes
    # where both we and some other shareholder are writing to the
    # mutable slot, and to report those back to the parts of the program
    # doing the writing.
    #
    # With SDMF, this was easy -- all of the share data was written in
    # one go, so it was easy to detect uncoordinated writes, and we only
    # had to do it once. With MDMF, not all of the file is written at
    # once.
    #
    # If a share is new, we write out as much of the header as we can
    # before writing out anything else. This gives other writers a
    # canary that they can use to detect uncoordinated writes, and, if
    # they do the same thing, gives us the same canary. We them update
    # the share. We won't be able to write out two fields of the header
    # -- the share tree hash and the salt hash -- until we finish
    # writing out the share. We only require the writer to provide the
    # initial checkstring, and keep track of what it should be after
    # updates ourselves.
    #
    # If we haven't written anything yet, then on the first write (which
    # will probably be a block + salt of a share), we'll also write out
    # the header. On subsequent passes, we'll expect to see the header.
    # This changes in two places:
    #
    #   - When we write out the salt hash
    #   - When we write out the root of the share hash tree
    #
    # since these values will change the header. It is possible that we
    # can just make those be written in one operation to minimize
    # disruption.
