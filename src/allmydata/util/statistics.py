    Computes the probability that a single file will become
    unrecoverable, based on the individual share survival
    probabilities and and k (number of shares needed for recovery).

    Example: pr_file_loss([.9] * 5 + [.99] * 5, 3) returns the
    probability that a file with k=3, N=10 and stored on five servers
    with reliability .9 and five servers with reliability .99 is lost.

    p=0.8.  The ith element of the resulting list is the probability
    that exactly i shares will survive.

    This calculation makes the following assumptions:

    1.  p_list[i] is the probability that any individual share will
    will survive during the time period in question (whatever that may
    be).

    2.  The share failures are "independent", in the statistical
    sense.  Note that if a group of shares are stored on the same
    machine or even in the same data center, they are NOT independent
