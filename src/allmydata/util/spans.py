class Spans(object):
    """I represent a compressed list of booleans, one per index (an integer).
    Typically, each index represents an offset into a large string, pointing
    to a specific byte of a share. In this context, True means that byte has
    been received, or has been requested.

    Another way to look at this is maintaining a set of integers, optimized
    for operations on spans like 'add range to set' and 'is range in set?'.

    This is a python equivalent of perl's Set::IntSpan module, frequently
    used to represent .newsrc contents.

    Rather than storing an actual (large) list or dictionary, I represent my
    internal state as a sorted list of spans, each with a start and a length.
    My API is presented in terms of start+length pairs. I provide set
    arithmetic operators, to efficiently answer questions like 'I want bytes
    XYZ, I already requested bytes ABC, and I've already received bytes DEF:
    what bytes should I request now?'.

    The new downloader will use it to keep track of which bytes we've requested
    or received already.
