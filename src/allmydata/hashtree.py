Read and write chunks from files.

Version 1.0.0.

A file is divided into blocks, each of which has size L{BLOCK_SIZE}
(except for the last block, which may be smaller).  Blocks are encoded
into chunks.  One publishes the hash of the entire file.  Clients
who want to download the file first obtain the hash, then the clients
can receive chunks in any order.  Cryptographic hashing is used to
verify each received chunk before writing to disk.  Thus it is
impossible to download corrupt data if one has the correct file hash.

One obtains the hash of a complete file via
L{CompleteChunkFile.file_hash}.  One can read chunks from a complete
file by the sequence operations of C{len()} and subscripting on a
L{CompleteChunkFile} object.  One can open an empty or partially
downloaded file with L{PartialChunkFile}, and read and write chunks
to this file.  A chunk will fail to write if its contents and index
are not consistent with the overall file hash passed to
L{PartialChunkFile} when the partial chunk file was first created.

The chunks have an overhead of less than 4% for files of size
less than C{10**20} bytes.

Benchmarks:

 - On a 3 GHz Pentium 3, it took 3.4 minutes to first make a
   L{CompleteChunkFile} object for a 4 GB file.  Up to 10 MB of
   memory was used as the constructor ran.  A metafile filename
   was passed to the constructor, and so the hash information was
   written to the metafile.  The object used a negligible amount
   of memory after the constructor was finished.
 - Creation of L{CompleteChunkFile} objects in future runs of the
   program took negligible time, since the hash information was
   already stored in the metafile.

@var BLOCK_SIZE:     Size of a block.  See L{BlockFile}.
@var MAX_CHUNK_SIZE: Upper bound on the size of a chunk.

        I am used to answer a question: supposing you have the data block

        I accept a leaf number and return a set of 'hash index' values, which

        can also be used to determine which hashes you should send to a
        remote data store so that it will be able to provide validatable data
        in the future.

        I will not include '0' (the root hash) in the result, since the root
        is generally stored somewhere that is more trusted than the source of

        'leaves' is a dictionary uses 'leaf index' values, which range from 0

        some 'good' channel and populate me with it:

         iht = IncompleteHashTree(numleaves)
         roothash = trusted_channel.get_roothash()
         iht.set_hashes(hashes={0: roothash})

        Then use the 'bad' channel to obtain data block 0 and the
        corresponding hash chain (a dict with the same hashes that
        needed_hashes(0) tells you, e.g. {0:h0, 2:h2, 4:h4, 8:h8} when
        len(L)=8). Hash the data block to create leaf0, then feed everything
        into set_hashes() and see if it raises an exception or not::

         otherhashes = untrusted_channel.get_hashes()
         # otherhashes.keys() should == iht.needed_hashes(leaves=[0])
         datablock0 = untrusted_channel.get_data(0)
         leaf0 = HASH(datablock0)
         # HASH() is probably hashutil.tagged_hash(tag, datablock0)
         iht.set_hashes(otherhashes, leaves={0: leaf0})

        If the set_hashes() call doesn't raise an exception, the data block
        was valid. If it raises BadHashError, then either the data block was
        corrupted or one of the received hashes was corrupted. If it raises
