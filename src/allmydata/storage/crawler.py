class ShareCrawler(service.MultiService):
    """A ShareCrawler subclass is attached to a StorageServer, and
    periodically walks all of its shares, processing each one in some
    fashion. This crawl is rate-limited, to reduce the IO burden on the host,
    since large servers can easily have a terabyte of shares, in several
    million files, which can take hours or days to read.

    Once the crawler starts a cycle, it will proceed at a rate limited by the
    allowed_cpu_percentage= and cpu_slice= parameters: yielding the reactor
    after it has worked for 'cpu_slice' seconds, and not resuming right away,
    always trying to use less than 'allowed_cpu_percentage'.

    Once the crawler finishes a cycle, it will put off starting the next one
    long enough to ensure that 'minimum_cycle_time' elapses between the start
    of two consecutive cycles.

    We assume that the normal upload/download/get_buckets traffic of a tahoe
    grid will cause the prefixdir contents to be mostly cached in the kernel,
    or that the number of buckets in each prefixdir will be small enough to
    load quickly. A 1TB allmydata.com server was measured to have 2.56M
    buckets, spread into the 1024 prefixdirs, with about 2500 buckets per
    prefix. On this server, each prefixdir took 130ms-200ms to list the first
    time, and 17ms to list the second time.

    To use a crawler, create a subclass which implements the process_bucket()
    method. It will be called with a prefixdir and a base32 storage index
    string. process_bucket() must run synchronously. Any keys added to
    self.state will be preserved. Override add_initial_state() to set up
    initial state keys. Override finished_cycle() to perform additional
    processing when the cycle is complete. Any status that the crawler
    produces should be put in the self.state dictionary. Status renderers
    (like a web page which describes the accomplishments of your crawler)
    will use crawler.get_state() to retrieve this dictionary; they can
    present the contents as they see fit.

    Then create an instance, with a reference to a StorageServer and a
    filename where it can store persistent state. The statefile is used to
    keep track of how far around the ring the process has travelled, as well
    as timing history to allow the pace to be predicted and controlled. The
    statefile will be updated and written to disk after each time slice (just
    before the crawler yields to the reactor), and also after each cycle is
    finished, and also when stopService() is called. Note that this means
    that a crawler which is interrupted with SIGKILL while it is in the
    middle of a time slice will lose progress: the next time the node is
    started, the crawler will repeat some unknown amount of work.

    The crawler instance must be started with startService() before it will
    do any work. To make it stop doing work, call stopService().
