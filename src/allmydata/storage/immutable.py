# each share file (in storage/shares/$SI/$SHNUM) contains lease information
# and share data. The share data is accessed by RIBucketWriter.write and
# RIBucketReader.read . The lease information is not accessible through these
# interfaces.

# The share file has the following layout:
#  0x00: share file version number, four bytes, current version is 1
#  0x04: share data length, four bytes big-endian = A # See Footnote 1 below.
#  0x08: number of leases, four bytes big-endian
#  0x0c: beginning of share data (see immutable.layout.WriteBucketProxy)
#  A+0x0c = B: first lease. Lease format is:
#   B+0x00: owner number, 4 bytes big-endian, 0 is reserved for no-owner
#   B+0x04: renew secret, 32 bytes (SHA256)
#   B+0x24: cancel secret, 32 bytes (SHA256)
#   B+0x44: expiration time, 4 bytes big-endian seconds-since-epoch
#   B+0x48: next lease, or end of record

# Footnote 1: as of Tahoe v1.3.0 this field is not used by storage servers,
# but it is still filled in by storage servers in case the storage server
# software gets downgraded from >= Tahoe v1.3.0 to < Tahoe v1.3.0, or the
# share file is moved from one storage server to another. The value stored in
# this field is truncated, so if the actual share data length is >= 2**32,
# then the value stored in this field will be the actual share data length
# modulo 2**32.
