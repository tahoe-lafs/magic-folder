    """I generate any shares which were not available and upload them to
    servers.

    Which servers? Well, I just use the normal upload process, so any servers
    that will take shares. In fact, I even believe servers if they say that
    they already have shares even if attempts to download those shares would
    fail because the shares are corrupted.

    My process of uploading replacement shares proceeds in a segment-wise
    fashion -- first I ask servers if they can hold the new shares, and wait
    until enough have agreed then I download the first segment of the file
    and upload the first block of each replacement share, and only after all
    those blocks have been uploaded do I download the second segment of the
    file and upload the second block of each replacement share to its
    respective server. (I do it this way in order to minimize the amount of
    downloading I have to do and the amount of memory I have to use at any
    one time.)

    If any of the servers to which I am uploading replacement shares fails to
    accept the blocks during this process, then I just stop using that
    server, abandon any share-uploads that were going to that server, and
    proceed to finish uploading the remaining shares to their respective
    servers. At the end of my work, I produce an object which satisfies the
    ICheckAndRepairResults interface (by firing the deferred that I returned
    from start() and passing that check-and-repair-results object).

    Before I send any new request to a server, I always ask the 'monitor'
    object that was passed into my constructor whether this task has been
    cancelled (by invoking its raise_if_cancelled() method).
