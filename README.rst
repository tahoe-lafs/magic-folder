INSTALLING
==========

via pip
^^^^^^^

Then, to install the most recent release, just run:

* ``pip install magic-folder``

from source
^^^^^^^^^^^
To install from source (either so you can hack on it, or just to run
pre-release code), you should create a virtualenv and install into that:

* ``git clone https://github.com/LeastAuthority/magic-folder.git``
* ``cd magic-folder``
* ``virtualenv --python=python2.7 venv``
* ``venv/bin/pip install --upgrade setuptools``
* ``venv/bin/pip install --editable .``
* ``venv/bin/magic-folder --version``

Usage
=====

Magic-Folder is configured via the ``magic-folder`` command-line tool.
This tool manipulates the ``magic_folders.yaml`` file in a Tahoe-LAFS' node's private area.
See the configuration documentation for full details.

Once Magic-Folder is configured,
functionality is provided by running a long-lived magic-folder side-car for the Tahoe-LAFS node.
Start the side-car process using the ``magic-folder`` command line too::

  magic-folder --node-directory /path/to/tahoe-lafs/node run

As long as this side-car is running,
whatever magic folders are configured will be functional.
The process must be restarted to read configuration changes.

TESTING
=======

To run the unit test suite:

* ``tox``

You can pass arguments to ``trial`` with an environment variable.  For
example, you can run the test suite on multiple cores to speed it up:

* ``MAGIC_FOLDER_TRIAL_ARGS="-j4" tox``

Documentation
=============

Documentation is written as reStructuredText documents and processed
using Sphinx; you will need ``sphinx`` and ``sphinx_rtd_theme``.  To
generate HTML version of Magic Folder documents, do:

* ``cd docs; make html``

Resulting HTML files will be under ``docs/_build/html/``.
