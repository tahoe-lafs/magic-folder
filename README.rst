INSTALLING
==========

via pip
^^^^^^^

Then, to install the most recent release, just run:

* ``pip install magic-folder``

from source
^^^^^^^^^^^
To install from source (either so you can hack on it, or just to run
pre-release code), you should create a virtualenv and install into that:

* ``git clone https://github.com/leastauthority/magic-folder.git``
* ``cd magic-folder``
* ``virtualenv --python=python2.7 venv``
* ``venv/bin/pip install --upgrade setuptools``
* ``venv/bin/pip install --editable .``
* ``venv/bin/magic_folder --version``

To run the unit test suite:

* ``tox``

You can pass arguments to ``trial`` with an environment variable.  For
example, you can run the test suite on multiple cores to speed it up:

* ``TAHOE_LAFS_TRIAL_ARGS="-j4" tox``
