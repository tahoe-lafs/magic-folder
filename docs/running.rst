How To Run Tahoe-LAFS
*********************

Introduction
============

This is how to run a Tahoe-LAFS client or a complete Tahoe-LAFS grid.
First you have to install the Tahoe-LAFS software, as documented in
:doc:`INSTALL`.

The ``tahoe`` program in your virtualenv's ``bin`` directory is used to
create, start, and stop nodes. Each node lives in a separate base
directory, in which there is a configuration file named ``tahoe.cfg``.
Nodes read and write files within this base directory.

A grid consists of a set of *storage nodes* and *client nodes* running
the Tahoe-LAFS code. There is also an *introducer node* that is
responsible for getting the other nodes talking to each other.

If you're getting started we recommend you try connecting to the `public test
grid`_ as you only need to create a client node. When you want to create your
own grid you'll need to create the introducer and several initial storage
nodes (see the note about small grids below).


Being Introduced to a Grid
--------------------------

A collection of Tahoe servers is called a Grid and usually has 1
Introducer (but sometimes more, and it's possible to run with zero). The
Introducer announces which storage servers constitute the Grid and how to
contact them. There is a secret "fURL" you need to know to talk to the
Introducer.

One way to get this secret is using traditional tools such as encrypted
email, encrypted instant-messaging, etcetera. It is important to transmit
this fURL secretly as knowing it gives you access to the Grid.

An additional way to share the fURL securely is via `magic
wormhole`_. This uses a weak one-time password and a server on the
internet (at `wormhole.tahoe-lafs.org`) to open a secure channel between
two computers. In Tahoe-LAFS this functions via the commands `tahoe
invite` and `tahoe create-client --join`. A person who already has access
to a Grid can use `tahoe invite` to create one end of the `magic
wormhole`_ and then transmits some JSON (including the Introducer's
secret fURL) to the other end. `tahoe invite` will print a one-time
secret code; you must then communicate this code to the person who will
join the Grid.

The other end of the `magic wormhole`_ in this case is `tahoe
create-client --join <one-time code>`, where the person being invited
types in the code they were given. Ideally, this code would be
transmitted securely. It is, however, only useful exactly once. Also, it
is much easier to transcribe by a human. Codes look like
`7-surrender-tunnel` (a short number and two words).


Running a Client
----------------

To construct a client node, run “``tahoe create-client``”, which will create
``~/.tahoe`` to be the node's base directory. Acquire the ``introducer.furl``
(see below if you are running your own introducer, or use the one from the
`TestGrid page`_), and paste it after ``introducer.furl =`` in the
``[client]`` section of ``~/.tahoe/tahoe.cfg``. Then use “``tahoe run
~/.tahoe``”. After that, the node should be off and running. The first thing
it will do is connect to the introducer and get itself connected to all other
nodes on the grid.

Some Grids use "magic wormhole" one-time codes to configure the basic
options. In such a case you use ``tahoe create-client --join
<one-time-code>`` and do not have to do any of the ``tahoe.cfg`` editing
mentioned above.

By default, “``tahoe create-client``” creates a client-only node, that
does not offer its disk space to other nodes. To configure other behavior,
use “``tahoe create-node``” or see :doc:`configuration`.

The “``tahoe run``” command above will run the node in the foreground.
On Unix, you can run it in the background instead by using the
“``tahoe start``” command. To stop a node started in this way, use
“``tahoe stop``”. ``tahoe --help`` gives a summary of all commands.


Running a Server or Introducer
------------------------------

To build either a storage server node, or an introducer node, you'll need
a way for clients to connect to it. The simplest case is when the
computer is on the public internet (e.g. a "VPS" virtual private server,
with a public IP address and a DNS hostname like ``example.net``). See
:doc:`servers` for help with more complex scenarios, using the ``--port``
and ``--location`` arguments.

To construct an introducer, create a new base directory for it (the name
of the directory is up to you), ``cd`` into it, and run “``tahoe
create-introducer --hostname=example.net .``” (but using the hostname of
your VPS). Now run the introducer using “``tahoe start .``”. After it
starts, it will write a file named ``introducer.furl`` into the
``private/`` subdirectory of that base directory. This file contains the
URL the other nodes must use in order to connect to this introducer.
(Note that “``tahoe run .``” doesn't work for introducers, this is a
known issue: `#937`_.)

You can distribute your Introducer fURL securely to new clients by using
the ``tahoe invite`` command. This will prepare some JSON to send to the
other side, request a `magic wormhole`_ code from
``wormhole.tahoe-lafs.org`` and print it out to the terminal. This
one-time code should be transmitted to the user of the client, who can
then run ``tahoe create-client --join <one-time-code>``.

Storage servers are created the same way: ``tahoe create-node
--hostname=HOSTNAME .`` from a new directory. You'll need to provide the
introducer FURL (either as a ``--introducer=`` argument, or by editing
the ``tahoe.cfg`` configuration file afterwards) to connect to the
introducer of your choice.

See :doc:`configuration` for more details about how to configure
Tahoe-LAFS.

A note about small grids
------------------------

By default, Tahoe-LAFS ships with the configuration parameter
``shares.happy`` set to 7. If you are using Tahoe-LAFS on a grid with
fewer than 7 storage nodes, this won't work well for you — none of your
uploads will succeed. To fix this, see :doc:`configuration` to learn how
to set ``shares.happy`` to a more suitable value for your grid.


Development with Docker
-----------------------

If you want to stand up a small local test environment, you can install 
`Docker`_ and `Docker Compose`_. Once you have cloned the repository, run 
``docker-compose up`` from the project's root directory. This will start a 
introducer, server, and a client configured to connect to them. After the 
containers start, you can access the WUI by navigating to 
``http://localhost:3456`` in your browser.

.. _Docker: https://docs.docker.com/
.. _Docker Compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/

Do Stuff With It
================

This is how to use your Tahoe-LAFS node.

The WUI
-------

Point your web browser to `http://127.0.0.1:3456`_ — which is the URL of the
gateway running on your own local computer — to use your newly created node.

Create a new directory (with the button labelled “create a directory”).
Your web browser will load the new directory.  Now if you want to be
able to come back to this directory later, you have to bookmark it, or
otherwise save a copy of the URL.  If you lose the URL to this directory,
then you can never again come back to this directory.

.. _http://127.0.0.1:3456: http://127.0.0.1:3456


The CLI
-------

Prefer the command-line? Run “``tahoe --help``” (the same command-line
tool that is used to start and stop nodes serves to navigate and use the
decentralized file store). To get started, create a new directory and
mark it as the 'tahoe:' alias by running “``tahoe create-alias tahoe``”.
Once you've done that, you can do “``tahoe ls tahoe:``” and “``tahoe cp
LOCALFILE tahoe:foo.txt``” to work with your file store. The Tahoe-LAFS
CLI uses similar syntax to the well-known scp and rsync tools. See
:doc:`frontends/CLI` for more details.


To backup a directory full of files and subdirectories, run “``tahoe backup
LOCALDIRECTORY tahoe:``”. This will create a new LAFS subdirectory inside the
“tahoe” LAFS directory named “Archive”, and inside “Archive”, it will create
a new subdirectory whose name is the current date and time. That newly
created subdirectory will be populated with a snapshot copy of all files and
directories currently reachable from LOCALDIRECTORY. Then ``tahoe backup``
will make a link to that snapshot directory from the “tahoe” LAFS directory,
and name the link “Latest”.

``tahoe backup`` cleverly avoids uploading any files or directories that
haven't changed, and it also cleverly deduplicates any files or directories
that have identical contents to other files or directories that it has
previously backed-up. This means that running ``tahoe backup`` is a nice
incremental operation that backs up your files and directories efficiently,
and if it gets interrupted (for example by a network outage, or by you
rebooting your computer during the backup, or so on), it will resume right
where it left off the next time you run ``tahoe backup``.

See :doc:`frontends/CLI` for more information about the ``tahoe backup``
command, as well as other commands.

As with the WUI (and with all current interfaces to Tahoe-LAFS), you
are responsible for remembering directory capabilities yourself. If you
create a new directory and lose the capability to it, then you cannot
access that directory ever again.


The SFTP and FTP frontends
--------------------------

You can access your Tahoe-LAFS grid via any SFTP_ or FTP_ client. See
:doc:`frontends/FTP-and-SFTP` for how to set this up. On most Unix
platforms, you can also use SFTP to plug Tahoe-LAFS into your computer's
local filesystem via ``sshfs``, but see the `FAQ about performance
problems`_.

The SftpFrontend_ page on the wiki has more information about using SFTP with
Tahoe-LAFS.
