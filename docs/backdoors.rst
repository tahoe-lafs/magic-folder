Statement on Backdoors
======================

October 5, 2010

The New York Times has `recently reported`_ that the current
U.S. administration is proposing a bill that would apparently, if passed,
require communication systems to facilitate government wiretapping and access
to encrypted data.

The core Tahoe developers promise never to change Tahoe-LAFS to facilitate
government access to data stored or transmitted by it. Even if it were
desirable to facilitate such access -- which it is not -- we believe it would
not be technically feasible to do so without severely compromising
Tahoe-LAFS' security against other attackers. There have been many examples
in which backdoors intended for use by government have introduced
vulnerabilities exploitable by other parties (a notable example being the
Greek cellphone eavesdropping scandal in 2004/5). RFCs `1984`_ and `2804`_
elaborate on the security case against such backdoors.

.. _2804: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2804

Note that since Tahoe-LAFS is open-source software, forks by people other
than the current core developers are possible. In that event, we would try to
persuade any such forks to adopt a similar policy.
