Governance
==========

The Tahoe-LAFS Software Foundation manages these funds. Our intention is
to use them for operational expenses (website hosting, test
infrastructure, EC2 instance rental, and SSL certificates). Future uses
might include developer summit expenses, bug bounties, contract services
(e.g. graphic design for the web site, professional security review of
codebases, development of features outside the core competencies of the
main developers), and student sponsorships.

The Foundation currently consists of secorp (Peter Secor), warner (Brian
Warner), and zooko (Zooko Wilcox).

Transparent Accounting
======================

Our current plan is to leave all funds in the main `1Pxi` key until they
are spent. For each declared budget item, we will allocate a new public
key, and transfer funds to that specific key before distributing them to
the ultimate recipient. All expenditures can thus be tracked on the
blockchain.

Some day, we might choose to move the funds into a more sophisticated
type of key (e.g. a 2-of-3 multisig address). If/when that happens, we
will publish the new donation address, and transfer all funds to it. We
will continue the plan of keeping all funds in the (new) primary
donation address until they are spent.

Expenditure Addresses
=====================

This lists the public key used for each declared budget item. The individual
payments will be recorded in a separate file (see `docs/expenses.rst`), which
is not signed. All transactions from the main `1Pxi` key should be to some
key on this list.
