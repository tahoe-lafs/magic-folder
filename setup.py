    #   transferring large mutable files of size N.
    # * foolscap < 0.6 is incompatible with Twisted 10.2.0.
    # * foolscap 0.6.1 quiets a DeprecationWarning.
    # * foolscap < 0.6.3 is incompatible with Twisted 11.1.0 and newer.
    # * foolscap 0.8.0 generates 2048-bit RSA-with-SHA-256 signatures,
    #   rather than 1024-bit RSA-with-MD5. This also allows us to work
    #   with a FIPS build of OpenSSL.
    # * foolscap >= 0.12.3 provides tcp/tor/i2p connection handlers we need,
    #   and allocate_tcp_port
    # * foolscap >= 0.12.5 has ConnectionInfo and ReconnectionInfo
    # * foolscap >= 0.12.6 has an i2p.sam_endpoint() that takes kwargs
    # * foolscap 0.13.2 drops i2p support completely
    "foolscap == 0.13.1",

    # * cryptography 2.6 introduced some ed25519 APIs we rely on.  Note that
    #   Twisted[conch] also depends on cryptography and Twisted[tls]
    #   transitively depends on cryptography.  So it's anyone's guess what
    #   version of cryptography will *really* be installed.

    # * On Linux we need at least Twisted 10.1.0 for inotify support
    #   used by the drop-upload frontend.
    # * We also need Twisted 10.1.0 for the FTP frontend in order for
    #   Twisted's FTP server to support asynchronous close.
    # * The SFTP frontend depends on Twisted 11.0.0 to fix the SSH server
    #   rekeying bug <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4395>
    # * The FTP frontend depends on Twisted >= 11.1.0 for
    #   filepath.Permissions
    # * Nevow 0.11.1 depends on Twisted >= 13.0.0.
    # * The SFTP frontend and manhole depend on the conch extra. However, we
    #   can't explicitly declare that without an undesirable dependency on gmpy,
    #   as explained in ticket #2740.
    # * Due to a setuptools bug, we need to declare a dependency on the tls
    #   extra even though we only depend on it via foolscap.
    # * Twisted >= 15.1.0 is the first version that provided the [tls] extra.
    # * Twisted-16.1.0 fixes https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/8223,
    #   which otherwise causes test_system to fail (DirtyReactorError, due to
    #   leftover timers)
    # * Twisted-16.4.0 introduces `python -m twisted.trial` which is needed
    #   for coverage testing
    # * Twisted 16.6.0 drops the undesirable gmpy dependency from the conch
    #   extra, letting us use that extra instead of trying to duplicate its
    #   dependencies here.  Twisted[conch] >18.7 introduces a dependency on
    #   bcrypt.  It is nice to avoid that if the user ends up with an older
    #   version of Twisted.  That's hard to express except by using the extra.
    #
    # * Twisted 18.4.0 adds `client` and `host` attributes to `Request` in the
    # * initializer, needed by logic in our custom `Request` subclass.
    #
    #   In a perfect world, Twisted[conch] would be a dependency of an "sftp"
    #   extra.  However, pip fails to resolve the dependencies all
    #   dependencies when asked for Twisted[tls] *and* Twisted[conch].
    #   Specifically, "Twisted[conch]" (as the later requirement) is ignored.
    #   If there were an Tahoe-LAFS sftp extra that dependended on
    #   Twisted[conch] and install_requires only included Twisted[tls] then
    #   `pip install tahoe-lafs[sftp]` would not install requirements
    #   specified by Twisted[conch].  Since this would be the *whole point* of
    #   an sftp extra in Tahoe-LAFS, there is no point in having one.
